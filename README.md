# 🌦️ Weather Data Pipeline — Weather Data API

> End-to-end data engineering project that fetches weather data from an API, loads it into Postgres, and builds transformations with dbt. Airflow is used for orchestration. (Superset visualization is planned but not included yet.)

## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a real-world **data engineering pipeline** built with modern tools and a modular architecture.

**Core workflow:**
1. Fetch live weather data from a REST API.
2. Store the raw and processed data in **PostgreSQL**.
3. Transform the data with **dbt** models.
4. Orchestrate the entire process with **Apache Airflow**.
5. (Optional in future) Visualize the results using **Apache Superset**.
